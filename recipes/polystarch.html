    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Polystarch Portion Bread: While it may look like simple fare, and it is,
      this portion bread is highly sought after on it's home planet Jakku. Once
      popular among the New Republic and Galactic Empire troops as a quick
      battle field meal, this commodity has come to rule much of the trade of
      Jakku due to sparse supplies of much else. A hearty instant bread loaf
      that requires only two ingredients and one step to complete, this will
      satiate the hunger of any weary traveler or scavenger.
