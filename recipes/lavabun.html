    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      The Mustafarian Lava Bun: sweet, crispy, and blackened to perfection.
      Traditionally, these fiery red delicacies are cooked directly on the hot
      volcanic surface of the planet Mustafar, but any old oven will do for this
      recipe. These round buns are soft and red in the core, and crackling black
      on the outer layer by using volcanic temperatures (or your oven probably).
      They're worth the burn.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Blue milk</li>
      <li>Bantha butter</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>Instant dry yeast</li>
      <li>Oil (vegetable or droid)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix flour and dry yeast into a bowl.</li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, mix blue milk, bantha butter, sugar, oil, water and
        heat up ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine the ingredients of both bowls and mix until consistency is
        smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape the dough into balls. Allow ten minutes for the dough to rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        If using an oven, cook on max temperature for fifteen minutes or until
        black and crispy on the outside. If using the volcanic surfaces of
        Mustafar, you already know what to do probably.

      <li>Enjoy</li>
